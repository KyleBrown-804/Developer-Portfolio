            <h4>
              I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Central Washington
              University. I have experience in multiple languages, frameworks,
              environments, and experience between both back-end and front-end
              development. I am interested in Web Development as well as
              back-end server side code and handling API connections. I enjoy
              writing queries and interactions between databases too.
              <br />
              <br />I am a fan of many genres of music and have been playing
              guitar for several years. I enjoy playing video games, primarily
              RPG's, but I also enjoy a few FPS games too. When I am not doing
              those hobbies, I am most likely hiking with my girlfriend and our
              cute little Corgi/Pug, Dio (named after the Anime villian).
