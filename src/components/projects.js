      "an insect, which would be identified using machine learning to determine if the insect was harmful " +
      "to crops. I implemented a REST API using Python Flask and hosted it on a Linux server and used NGINX " +
      "as a reverse proxy to handle routing API requests. I implemented front-end to back-end connections " +
      "by sending user images to the API using AJAX, which would then be validated with a machine learning model kept " +
      "server side. I also handled integrating SSL certification with Certbot and added Fail2Ban for security measures. " +

      "switch to a viewing tab where they can scroll through and click to view any saved recipes. I also implemented " +
